# Introductory Speech
Hi my name is Josef and I have been a PC gamer for over 10 years, and enjoy knowing ins and outs of computers which brought me to this new career path with Savvy Coders. Im really into pc gaming so when given the opportunity to think about my capstone project, I wanted to create a informative website to help newer players with strategizing within the game of Destiny.

## Who is the target audience?
Gamers

## What is your "Unique Selling Proposition" or what makes you different from the competition?
With research there is no formal website that is able to produce the results im trying to provide.

## Close with a strong "Call to Action"!
"Maximize your damage."


## Definition Statement
I want to build an application that give players the ability to use and maximize their dmg in a given scenario.

## Definition of Audience
Gamers, Destiny players (new & old)

## Who is using my application
New players to the game

## What do I want on each page?
text / pics / images / navigation

# What is the purpose of my application?
I created this application because everyone's time is valuable, have you ever been working on a task or project
with someone who is new to the space, or needs more direction? You work thru the project with your team and find out in the end something was done incorrectly, and you have to start the entire project over again? That is a lot of your everyone elses time wasted. That is what im trying to solve.

## What business problem or real world problem am I going to be solving?
Saving time
